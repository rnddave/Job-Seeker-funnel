**Creating a new job lead**

When viewing your copy of the **Projects**, you will likely start in the kanban view. 

- Starting from **Awareness**
- Create a new Job Lead (I would recommend better names than the test names from my example project)
- The new item will appear as a **draft** in the **Awareness** column
- Hover next to the word **Draft** and select the 3 dots [**...**]
- Select **Convert to issue**
- You are asked which **repository** to link this to, select your copy of the **job seeker funnel** template repository
- This will change the status to Open
- You can now select the new job item
- You are asked to enter comments (optional) each time you change anything)
- It is recommended to record any notes related to each job funnel stage
- You chould also record dates for things like awareness etc as these will then show on a timeline if you are interested in such things.
