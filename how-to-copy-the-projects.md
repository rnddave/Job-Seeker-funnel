**How to copy and What to copy**

I haven't figured out a way of copying both the **Repo** and **Project** in a single action yet... 

However, the Project was where most of the effort was, I use the Repo as a place to store documents relating to job descriptions etc. 

- Log in to your GitHub
- Go to the [Project](https://github.com/users/rnddave/projects/13)
- At the top right, just under your GitHub profile pic, click the 3 dots [**...**]
- Select **Make a copy**
- A dialog window pops up, I recommend you select **Draft issues will be copied if selected** and then click **Copy project**

You now have a copy of the project, in my case, I link it directly to a **repository** as this will allow me to **Open** activities and to store job descriptions etc, it also keeps a description of the overall project/repo and what the Job Seeker Funnel is trying to mimc etc.

You can also clone a copy of my repo template if you want:

- Log in to your GitHub
- Go to the [Job Seeker Funnel](https://github.com/rnddave/Job-Seeker-funnel)
- At the top right, you should see **Fork**, click the dropdown and **create a new fork**
- this should then take you to a copy of the repo that is now in your private GitHub workspace

At this stage you probably want to link the project and the repo together, you also might want to consider privacy options: 

**Link the Project to the Repo**

- Go to **your** copy of the **Repository**
- Click on **Projects**
- Roughly middle of the screen, to the right is a big green button **Link a project** select this, **not** the drop down arrow
- Select **your** copy of the **Project**
- Click away from the selection, the page should reload with your copy of the project listed

**Addressing privacy**

Now your copy of the project should be private by default, at least that is what my testing shows. However, your copy of the **Job seeker Repository** will be public because the one you cloned will be public, you might want to address this so that job descriptions and any other job seeking activities are private to you. 

- Towards the top, there is a **Settings** with a Gear, select this
- Scroll to the bottom, select **Change Visibility**
