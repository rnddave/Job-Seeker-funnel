**How to copy and What to copy**

I haven't figured out a way of copying both the **Repo** and **Project** in a single action yet... 

However, the Project is where most of the effort would be, I use the Repo as a place to store documents relating to job descriptions etc. 

- Log in to your GitHub
- Go to the [Project](https://github.com/users/rnddave/projects/13)
- At the top right, just under your GitHub profile pic, click the 3 dots [**...**]
- Select **Make a copy**
- A dialog window pops up, I recommend you select **Draft issues will be copied if selected** and then click **Copy project**

You now have a copy of the project, in my case, I link it directly to a **repository** as this will allow me to **Open** activities and to store job descriptions etc, it also keeps a description of the overall project/repo and what the Job Seeker Funnel is trying to mimc etc.

You can also clone a copy of my **repo template** if you want (this repo):

- Log in to your GitHub
- Go to the [Job Seeker Funnel](https://github.com/rnddave/Job-Seeker-funnel)
- Click on **Use this template**
- Select **Create a new repository**
- Give it a name of your choosing
- Scroll to the bottom and set to **Private**
- Click **Create repository**

At this stage you probably want to link the project and the repo together: 

**Link the Project to the Repo**

- Go to **your** copy of the **Repository**
- Click on **Projects** (towards the top-middle of the page)
- Roughly middle of the screen, to the right is a big green button **Link a project** select this, **not** the drop down arrow
- Select **your** copy of the **Project**
- Click away from the selection, the page should reload with your copy of the project listed

Now you can create job leads in your project (they start as Drafts) in the Awareness stage.
